NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.832 --> 00:00:02.449
I love infographics.

00:00:02.473 --> 00:00:04.187
As an information designer,

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:07.413
I've worked with all sorts of data
over the past 25 years.

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:10.838
I have a few insights to share,
but first: a little history.

NOTE Paragraph

00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:17.781
Communication is the encoding,
transmission and decoding of information.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.543
Breakthroughs in communication mark
turning points in human culture.

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:28.192
Oracy, literacy and numeracy
were great developments in communication.

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.897
They allow us to encode ideas into words

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:32.634
and quantities into numbers.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.240
Without communication, we'd still
be stuck in the Stone Ages.

NOTE Paragraph

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:40.612
Although humans have been around
for a quarter million years,

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:43.684
it was only 8,000 years ago
that proto-writings began to surface.

00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:48.619
Nearly 3,000 years later, the first
proper writing systems took shape.

NOTE Paragraph

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:56.201
Maps have been around for millennia
and diagrams for hundreds of years,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.059
but representing quantities
through graphics

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.843
is a relatively new development.

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:06.066
It wasn't until 1786 that William Playfair
invented the first bar chart,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.784
giving birth to visual display
of quantitative information.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.781
Fifteen years later, he introduced
the first pie and area charts.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:18.778
His inventions are still the most
commonly used chart forms today.

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:24.896
Florence Nightingale invented
the coxcomb in 1857

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.828
for a presentation to Queen Victoria
on troop mortality.

00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:29.365
Highlighted in blue,

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.886
she showed how most troops' deaths
could have been prevented.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.114
Shortly after, Charles Minard charted
Napoleon's march on Moscow,

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:45.385
illustrating how an army of 422,000
dwindled to just 10,000

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.861
as battles, geography and freezing
temperatures took their toll.

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:53.013
He combined a Sankey diagram
with cartography

00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:54.785
and a line chart for temperature.

NOTE Paragraph

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.838
I get excited when I get
lots of data to play with,

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:02.704
especially when it yields
an interesting chart form.

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:09.001
Here, Nightingale's coxcomb
was the inspiration

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:12.264
to organize data on thousands
of federal energy subsidies,

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:16.196
scrutinizing the lack of investment
in renewables over fossil fuels.

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:22.755
This Sankey diagram illustrates
the flow of energy through the US economy,

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.096
emphasizing how nearly half
of the energy used is lost as waste heat.

NOTE Paragraph

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.774
I love it when data can be sculpted
into beautiful shapes.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:38.230
Here, the personal and professional
connections of the women of Silicon Valley

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:40.146
can be woven into arcs,

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.314
same as the collaboration of inventors
birthing patents across the globe

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:47.681
can be mapped.

NOTE Paragraph

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.189
I've even made charts for me.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.726
I'm a numbers person,
so I rarely win at Scrabble.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.476
I made this diagram to remember
all the two- and three-letter words

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.276
in the official Scrabble dictionary.

NOTE Paragraph

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.381
(Laughter)

NOTE Paragraph

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:03.259
Knowing these 1,168 words
certainly is a game changer.

NOTE Paragraph

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.297
(Laughter)

NOTE Paragraph

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.440
Sometimes I produce code
to quickly generate graphics

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:10.256
from thousands of data points.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.754
Coding also enables me
to produce interactive graphics.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:18.080
Now we can navigate information
on our own terms.

NOTE Paragraph

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:22.310
Exotic chart forms certainly look cool,

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.211
but something as simple
as a little dot may be all you need

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.332
to solve a particular thinking task.

00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:33.783
In 2006, the "New York Times"
redesigned their "Markets" section,

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:36.254
cutting it down from eight pages
of stock listings

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:39.175
to just one and a half pages
of essential market data.

00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:43.302
We listed performance metrics
for the most common stocks,

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:47.082
but I wanted to help investors
see how the stocks are doing.

00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:49.826
So I added a simple little dot

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.932
to show the current price
relative to its one-year range.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:58.412
At a glance, value investors can pick out
stocks trading near their lows

00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:00.304
by looking for dots to the left.

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:04.418
Momentum investors can find stocks
on an upward trajectory

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:05.901
via dots to the right.

00:04:06.354 --> 00:04:09.179
Shortly after, the "Wall Street Journal"
copied the design.

NOTE Paragraph

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.339
Simplicity is often the goal
for most graphics,

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:15.102
but sometimes we need
to embrace complexity

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:18.279
and show large data sets
in their full glory.

00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:24.049
Alec Gallup, the former chairman
of the Gallup Organization,

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:26.060
once handed me a very thick book.

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:27.386
It was his family's legacy:

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.770
hundreds of pages covering six decades
of presidential approval data.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.094
I told him the entire book
could be graphed on a single page.

00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:36.498
"Impossible," he said.

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:40.156
And here it is:

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.992
25,000 data points on a single page.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:46.782
At a glance, one sees that most presidents
start with a high approval rating,

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.219
but few keep it.

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:50.498
Events like wars initially boost approval;

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.380
scandals trigger declines.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.594
These major events were annotated
in the graphic but not in the book.

00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.977
The point is, graphics can transmit data
with incredible efficiency.

NOTE Paragraph

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.422
Graphicacy --

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:07.831
the ability to read and write graphics --

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.452
is still in its infancy.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.521
New chart forms will emerge
and specialized dialects will evolve.

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:15.570
Graphics that help us think faster

00:05:15.594 --> 00:05:18.909
or see a book's worth
of information on a single page

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:22.388
are the key to unlocking new discoveries.

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:26.812
Our visual cortex was built
to decode complex information

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:29.416
and is a master at pattern recognition.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.876
Graphicacy enables us
to harness our built-in GPU

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.560
to process mountains of data

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.662
and find the veins of gold hiding within.

NOTE Paragraph

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:38.354
Thank you.

NOTE Paragraph

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:41.151
(Applause and cheers)
